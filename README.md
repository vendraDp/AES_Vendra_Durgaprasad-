# AES

## Sub heading
This repository contains the source codes and a brief description of Advanced Encrytion Standard using Verilog.

Data encryption has become an indispensable requirement in todayâ€™s apps, transactions, and
webpages and the applications are endless. Along with encrypting the sensitive data, authenticity
also needs to be verified. Many remote devices require an encryption scheme to transmit the
information. We implement an authenticated encryption scheme that resists replay attacks.
