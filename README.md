# Hardware Efficient 256-bit AES Encryption and Decryption Algorithm



Data encryption has become an indispensable requirement in today’s apps, transactions, and
webpages and the applications are endless. Along with encrypting the sensitive data, authenticity
also needs to be verified. Many remote devices require an encryption scheme to transmit the
information. We implement an authenticated encryption scheme that resists replay attacks.

## Cryptographic techniques
### Symmetric-key cryptography
▢ Both the sender and receiver share a single key.
▢ The sender uses this key to encrypt the plaintext.
▢ On the other side, the receiver uses the same key to decrypt the message and recover
the plaintext. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the most celebrated example.
